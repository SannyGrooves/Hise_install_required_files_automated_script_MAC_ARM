# Hise install required files (automated script) MAC ARM
AUTOMATED SCRIPT TO INSTALL ALL REQUIRED FILES FOR USING HISE VST BUILDER

script for setting up the HISE VST development program on a macOS ARM-based machine and add error handlers, we’ll streamline the code, improve efficiency, and enhance robustness. The optimized script will:

    Minimize redundant checks and operations.
    Use more efficient tools and commands (e.g., curl over wget, streamlined Homebrew setup).
    Add comprehensive error handling for each major step (e.g., dependency installation, SDK download, repository cloning).
    Log errors to a file for debugging.
    Provide user-friendly feedback and recovery options.
    Maintain the same functionality: install Homebrew, dependencies, HISE, VST3 SDK, and provide ASIO SDK instructions, tailored for macOS ARM.

Optimization Strategies:

    Homebrew: Combine update and install steps, check for Homebrew only once.
    Dependencies: Install all Homebrew packages in a single command to reduce overhead.
    Error Handling: Add try-catch-like logic using || and custom error functions to handle failures gracefully.
    Logging: Save errors to a log file ($HOME/hise_install.log) for troubleshooting.
    Progress Feedback: Use clear, concise messages with timestamps.
    Path Handling: Ensure robust directory creation and permission checks.
    SDK Download: Verify file integrity post-download (basic size check).
    Projucer: Check and set correct permissions efficiently.

Below is the optimized install.sh script with error handlers.

x-shellscript
Optimizations Made:

    Single Homebrew Command: Combined brew update and brew install to reduce overhead.
    Streamlined Checks: Reduced redundant command_exists calls by installing curl via Homebrew upfront.
    Efficient PATH Setup: Added Homebrew PATH only once after installation.
    Directory Creation: Combined mkdir -p with permission setting (chmod) for efficiency.
    Error Handling: Added handle_error function to centralize error logging and exit logic, reducing code duplication.
    Logging: Consolidated all output to $LOG_FILE with timestamps for debugging.
    File Integrity: Added basic file size check for VST3 SDK download to catch corrupted files.
    User Feedback: Concise messages with clear recovery instructions (e.g., rerun script after Xcode installation).

Error Handlers Added:

    Homebrew Installation: Checks for installation failure and suggests checking internet or Homebrew website.
    Dependency Installation: Catches brew install failures and recommends running brew doctor.
    Xcode Tools: Exits gracefully if Xcode tools are missing, with instructions to rerun after installation.
    Git Cloning/Pulling: Handles network or repository access issues.
    VST3 SDK Download/Extraction: Checks for download failures, empty files, or extraction issues (e.g., wrong password).
    Directory Creation: Ensures directories are created and permissions are set correctly.
    Projucer: Verifies Projucer existence and permissions.

Usage:

    Save as install.sh.
    Make executable: chmod +x install.sh.
    Run: ./install.sh.
    Check $HOME/hise_install.log if errors occur.

Notes:

    VST3 SDK: The URL and password (4321) are based on available data. Verify with Steinberg’s developer portal for updates.
    ASIO SDK: Left as a manual step due to licensing restrictions; the script provides clear instructions.
    ARM Compatibility: Ensured all tools are installed via Homebrew’s ARM-native packages (/opt/homebrew).
    Further Customization: If you need additional features (e.g., specific plugin formats like AU, sample integration, or Intel Mac support), let me know, and I can adjust the script.
    Log File: Check $HOME/hise_install.log for detailed error messages if the script fails.
